1. use wikipedia for relation extraction 

first task is to desighn a tool to compute the distance between two nodes,
what we did in first paper was using similar words , now do we have to use the same (most probably not)
--> we will use content to find the distance or some other thing.
## we will be using wikidata for this task
2. Graph levelling . 

Easy graph algorithms , can be easilty implemented..


Methodology trying to use:

1. Try what is possible with SPARQL:


2. Maybe do id searching using python webdriver:


3. And then do instances searching using SPARQL.

### what we are going to do is first find the page on wikipedia and then find wikidata item from it 

### we also have to make the rules of what relationships are extracted .

1 1..to go up on the graph 

#use relationship on part of (Statement)P361;

2 2.. to go down on the graph 

#what items are part of a node


up ===> what nodes are is the given item part of (maybe possible ==> to be checked)

down ===> what nodes are the part of the given item (possible and can be done )


is a subclass of P279:
is a part of P361:

##code to go up the graph:
SELECT ?item ?itemLabel
WHERE
{
  wd:Q21198 wdt:P361 ?item.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
}

here can also do P279 ; #P361 returns error:

##code to go down the grpah :

SELECT ?item ?itemLabel
WHERE
{
  ?item  wdt:P361 wd:Q21198 
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
}

##can also define other relationships as well if wanted to put in the graph.

##python wrapper for query launguage:

##see what relation to use:
1. instance of 
2. part of 
3. subclass of
